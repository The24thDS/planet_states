  ps.13.desc: "Salutations, comrade. Welcome to the §Y[target_planet_state.GetName]§!.\n\nOur little communal utopia has seen many, many empires come and go. Hopefully your stay in the galactic board will be more permament.\n\nOur only interest is the welfare of our citizens. As long as you don't put their liberty and prosperity in risk, I'm sure we peacefully share this system."
  ps.14.desc: "You are in the august presence of [target_planet_state.Ruler.GetTitle] [target_planet_state.Ruler.GetName], ruler of the §Y[target_planet_state.GetName]§!.\n\n[target_planet_state.capital_scope.GetName] is mine by birthright.

  ps.15.desc: "Another little race has reached the stars, huh?\n\nWe are the §Y[target_planet_state.GetName]§!, a warrior nation only interested in training our soldiers. Training for what, you ask? The next intergalactic crisis that will destroy all life in the universe, of course. It tends to happen every few millenia. Judging by the recent influx of newcomers to the galactic stage, I would say we have about 200 years until the next crisis. Exciting, right?\n\nUntil then, do whatever you want with this system. Just leave our warriors alone. We have much training to do."
  ps.16.desc: "Warm regards from the §Y[target_planet_state.GetName]§!, new friend.\n\nWe are a simple, peaceful society of farmers that wish no more than to live in harmony with nature. I'm sure our presence will bring nothing but benefits for you. That is, if you notice us at all."
