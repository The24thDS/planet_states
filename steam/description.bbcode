This is the [b]updated[/b] version of the Planet States mod originally made by [url=https://github.com/lpslucasps]lpslucasps[/url].

I've decided to maintain the mod since he has been inactive for the last 16 months.
[b]Contributions are welcome and encouraged on [url=https://github.com/The24thDS/planet_states]Github[/url].[/b]

This mod adds a bunch of independent, sovereign planets for you to interact with (or conquer), called Planet States.
These Planet States will spawn at the start of the game in random systems and will have random names.

[h1]Bug reporting and ideas[/h1]

Please use the [url=https://discord.gg/4xfQ78sPpm]RMG Discord[/url] for reporting bugs and giving feedback (select the Smaller Projects role in #roles then head to #24thds_mods). It's much easier to have everything in one place. However I will still take a look at the mod comments from time to time.
