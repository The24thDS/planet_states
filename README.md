This is the updated version of the Planet States mod originally made by [lpslucasps](https://github.com/lpslucasps).

I've decided to fork his repo and maintain the mod since he has been inactive for the last 16 months.
Contributions are welcome and encouraged.

This mod adds a bunch of independent, sovereign planets for you to interact with (or conquer), called Planet States.
These Planet States will spawn at the start of the game in random systems and will have random names.

## Fanatic Egalitarian

You can also sign a Commercial Pact with them once you have good relations. The pact will increase your Trade Value by 5%.
